# Performance Analysis Configuration

This configuration defines performance scenarios, baseline capture settings, and optimization targets for the sdlc-workflow performance optimization workflow.

## Performance Scenarios

List the key user workflows and pages to measure. Each scenario should represent a distinct user journey.

**Note:** Scenarios will be auto-populated by `performance-baseline` after workflow selection.

| Scenario Name | URL Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| (Will be populated after workflow selection) | - | - |

## Baseline Capture Settings

| Setting | Value | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Iterations | 20 | Number of times to run each scenario |
| Warmup Runs | 2 | Iterations to discard before collecting metrics |
| Metrics to Collect | LCP, FCP, DOM Interactive, Total Load Time, Resource Timing | Core Web Vitals and resource-level metrics |
| Browser | Chromium (headless) | Playwright browser for automation |

## Baseline Capture Mode

Determines how performance metrics are captured.

**Status:** Not yet configured (will be set during first baseline capture)

| Mode | Description | Use Case |
|---|---|---|
| **cold-start** | Direct URL navigation with cold cache | Worst-case performance (first visit, direct links, bookmarks) |

**Configured Mode:** cold-start (only supported mode)

**Important:** All baseline captures use cold-start mode for consistent cold-cache measurements.

## Target Directories

| Directory | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `.claude/performance/baselines/` | Baseline performance reports |
| `.claude/performance/analysis/` | Module and application analysis reports |
| `.claude/performance/plans/` | Optimization plan documents |
| `.claude/performance/optimization-results/` | Per-task optimization results (audit trail) |
| `.claude/performance/verification/` | Verification reports for optimization PRs |

## Optimization Targets

Performance thresholds to achieve after optimization. The metrics shown depend on the analysis scope configured during setup.

**Status:** Baseline values not yet captured

### Frontend Metrics

Core Web Vitals thresholds for browser performance (populated when analysis_scope includes frontend).

| Metric | Baseline (p95) | Latest Verified (p95) | Target | Unit | Last Updated |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| LCP (Largest Contentful Paint) | {{lcp-baseline}} | {{lcp-latest}} | {{lcp-target}} | seconds | {{lcp-updated}} |
| FCP (First Contentful Paint) | {{fcp-baseline}} | {{fcp-latest}} | {{fcp-target}} | seconds | {{fcp-updated}} |
| DOM Interactive | {{dom-baseline}} | {{dom-latest}} | {{dom-target}} | seconds | {{dom-updated}} |
| Total Load Time | {{total-baseline}} | {{total-latest}} | {{total-target}} | seconds | {{total-updated}} |

### Backend Metrics

API performance thresholds for backend endpoints (populated when analysis_scope includes backend).

| Metric | Baseline (p95) | Latest Verified (p95) | Target | Unit | Last Updated |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Response Time (p95) | {{resp-p95-baseline}} | {{resp-p95-latest}} | {{resp-p95-target}} | milliseconds | {{resp-p95-updated}} |
| Response Time (p99) | {{resp-p99-baseline}} | {{resp-p99-latest}} | {{resp-p99-target}} | milliseconds | {{resp-p99-updated}} |
| Throughput | {{throughput-baseline}} | {{throughput-latest}} | {{throughput-target}} | req/sec | {{throughput-updated}} |
| Error Rate | {{error-baseline}} | {{error-latest}} | {{error-target}} | % | {{error-updated}} |
| Database Query Time (p95) | {{db-baseline}} | {{db-latest}} | {{db-target}} | milliseconds | {{db-updated}} |

**Columns explained:**
- **Baseline (p95):** Initial value from first baseline capture (never changes)
- **Latest Verified (p95):** Most recent measured value on main branch (updated by re-running `/performance-baseline` after merging optimizations)
- **Target:** Goal to achieve (can be adjusted based on requirements)
- **Last Updated:** Timestamp of last metric update

**Note:** Baseline values will be auto-filled after first `/sdlc-workflow:performance-baseline` run. Latest Verified values track the current state on main branch - re-run baseline after merging each optimization PR to measure cumulative progress.

**Target value guidelines:**
- **Frontend targets** follow Google's Core Web Vitals "Good" thresholds
- **Backend targets** are configurable based on your SLA requirements

## Module Registry

Frontend modules/pages to analyze individually. Each entry represents a distinct bundle or route that can be optimized separately.

**Note:** Modules will be auto-populated by `performance-baseline` after workflow selection.

| Module Name | Entry Point | Description |
|---|---|---|
| (Will be populated after workflow selection) | - | - |

## Repository Configuration

This section tracks the repositories involved in performance analysis based on the configured analysis scope.

### Frontend Repository

| Setting | Value | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Repository Name | {{frontend-repo-name}} | Frontend repository name |
| Repository Path | {{/absolute/path/to/frontend}} | Absolute path to frontend repository |
| Framework | {{frontend-framework}} | e.g., React, Vue, Angular, Svelte |
| Bundler | {{bundler}} | e.g., Rsbuild, Vite, Webpack, Rollup |

### Backend Repository

| Setting | Value | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Repository Name | {{backend-repo-name}} | Backend repository name |
| Repository Path | {{/absolute/path/to/backend}} | Absolute path to backend repository |
| Framework | {{backend-framework}} | e.g., actix-web, axum, spring-boot, express, fastapi |
| Serena Instance | {{serena-instance}} | Instance name from Code Intelligence section (or "none") |
| API Base Path | {{/api/v2}} | Base path for API routes (e.g., /api/v1, /api/v2) |
| Backend Available | false | Cached validation status (auto-updated) |
| Last Validated | - | Timestamp of last validation check |

**Analysis Capabilities by Scope:**
- **full-stack:** Both frontend and backend repositories configured → Full cross-layer analysis (bundle, browser metrics, API handlers, database queries, over-fetching detection)
- **frontend-only:** Frontend repository only → Frontend analysis (bundle, browser metrics, component rendering, API usage patterns)
- **backend-only:** Backend repository only → Backend analysis (API endpoints, database queries, caching, pagination, response schemas)

**Note:** Repository configuration can be edited manually if needed.

## Analysis Scope

**Current Mode:** {{analysis-scope}}

The analysis scope determines which repositories are analyzed and what performance metrics are collected:

- **full-stack-monorepo:** Frontend and backend in same repository → Full cross-layer analysis (bundle, browser metrics, API handlers, database queries, over-fetching detection)
- **full-stack:** Frontend and backend in separate repositories → Full cross-layer analysis (bundle, browser metrics, API handlers, database queries, over-fetching detection)
- **frontend-only:** Frontend repository only → Frontend analysis (bundle, browser metrics, component rendering, API usage patterns)
- **backend-only:** Backend repository only → Backend analysis (API endpoints, database queries, caching, pagination, response schemas)

This is configured during setup and determines which sections of the Repository Configuration are populated.

**To change analysis scope:** Re-run `/sdlc-workflow:performance-setup` and select a different option.

## Development Environment

Commands and configuration for starting the application during performance testing.

| Setting | Value | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Dev Command | TBD | Command to start application (e.g., `npm run dev`) |
| Documentation Source | TBD | Where command was discovered (package.json, README.md, etc.) |
| Port | TBD | Port where dev server runs |
| Command Approved | false | User has approved this command for execution |
| Command Hash | - | SHA-256 hash for change detection |
| Last Validated | - | Timestamp of last successful execution |

**Note:** The dev command will be auto-discovered during the first baseline capture run. You can modify it before approval if needed (e.g., add environment variables like `AUTH_DISABLED=true npm run dev`).

## Analysis Assumptions

Constants used by `performance-analyze-module` when estimating impact of detected anti-patterns.
Adjust these to match your environment for more accurate estimates.

| Assumption | Value | Unit | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| Average Bandwidth | 5 | Mbps | Network bandwidth for bundle size impact calculation (frontend) |
| API Latency (average) | 100 | ms | Baseline API round-trip time for N+1 impact calculation |
| Layout Reflow Cost | 5 | ms | CPU time per forced reflow operation (frontend) |
| Cache Hit Rate | 0.8 | ratio (0.0–1.0) | Proportion of API requests expected to be served from cache |
| DB Query Base Latency | 10 | ms | Per-query database overhead for N+1 query impact estimation (backend) |
| Concurrent Connection Limit | 100 | connections | Maximum concurrent requests the backend can handle (backend) |

**Note:** Impact estimates derived from these constants are order-of-magnitude approximations.
For frontend optimizations, verify with browser profiling tools. For backend optimizations, verify with load testing and database profiling tools before committing.

## Selected Workflow

No workflow selected yet. Run `/sdlc-workflow:performance-baseline` to discover and select a workflow.

The baseline skill will:
1. Discover workflows from your application's routes
2. Prompt you to select a target workflow
3. Auto-populate Performance Scenarios and Module Registry sections
4. Capture initial performance metrics

**Next Steps:**
1. Ensure your application is running locally
2. Run `/sdlc-workflow:performance-baseline` to discover workflows and capture baseline
