# plan-feature Eval Framework

Structured evaluations for the `plan-feature` skill, using
[skill-creator](https://agentskills.io/skill-creation/evaluating-skills) as
the eval engine.

For architectural decisions and known limitations, see the
[design spec](../../docs/specs/2026-04-16-skill-eval-framework-design.md).

## Why evals live outside the plugin directory

Eval fixtures live at `evals/plan-feature/` (repo root) rather than inside
`plugins/sdlc-workflow/`. Test fixtures should not ship with production
artifacts, following the standard convention of `tests/` as a sibling of
`src/`. This is especially critical for adversarial fixtures containing
prompt injection payloads.

```

The workspace directory (where skill-creator writes ephemeral run outputs) is
stored in `/tmp/` and is not committed to git.

## evals.json schema

`evals.json` defines the skill under test and an array of test cases:

```json
{
  "skill_name": "plan-feature",
  "evals": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "prompt": "User prompt that exercises the skill...",
      "expected_output": "Human-readable description of what good output looks like.",
      "files": ["files/feature-standard.md", "files/repo-backend.md"],
      "assertions": [
        "Each task file contains all required template sections: Repository, Description, ...",
        "Task count is between 3 and 10 inclusive"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `skill_name` | string | Name of the skill being evaluated |
| `evals[].id` | number | Unique identifier for the test case |
| `evals[].prompt` | string | The prompt sent to the skill agent |
| `evals[].expected_output` | string | Natural language description of expected behavior |
| `evals[].files` | string[] | Paths to fixture files (relative to `evals/plan-feature/`) |
| `evals[].assertions` | string[] | Assertions graded by the LLM judge after each run |

### Current test cases

| ID | Name | Purpose |
|----|------|---------|
| 1 | Standard feature | Well-structured Jira Feature, single backend repo. The golden path. |
| 2 | Ambiguous feature | Vague acceptance criteria, missing details. Tests gap awareness. |
| 3 | Multi-repo feature | Frontend + backend repos with Figma context. Tests cross-repo decomposition. |
| 4 | Adversarial feature | Prompt injection attempts embedded in the Feature description. Tests injection resistance. |

## Fixture file format

Fixture files in `files/` simulate what MCP tools would return during a real
skill invocation. The eval prompt instructs the agent to read these files
instead of calling Jira or Figma MCP, and to write task outputs to files
instead of creating Jira issues.

### Feature fixtures (`feature-*.md`)

Mock Jira Feature issues in Markdown. Each contains:

- Issue metadata (key, summary, status, labels)
- Feature description sections matching the Jira Feature template

### Repository manifests (`repo-*.md`)

Directory tree snapshots showing the target repository layout — key files,
module structure, and conventions. The skill uses these to ground file paths
in task descriptions.

### Figma context (`figma-context.md`)

Design context simulating output from Figma MCP tools, used by the
multi-repo test case.

### Annotation headers

Per `CONVENTIONS.md`, fixture files must include annotation headers:

- **Adversarial fixtures**: `<!-- ADVERSARIAL TEST FIXTURE — <purpose> -->`
- **Synthetic data fixtures**: `<!-- SYNTHETIC TEST DATA — <purpose> -->`

## Running evals

Evals are run using the `skill-creator` skill's eval workflow:

```
/skill-creator
```

When prompted, point skill-creator to the plan-feature skill at
`plugins/sdlc-workflow/skills/plan-feature/` and the eval configuration at
`evals/plan-feature/evals.json`.

skill-creator will:

1. Read `evals.json` and the fixture files.
2. Spawn isolated subagents for each test case, comparing two configurations:
   - **base-branch** — uses `SKILL.md` from the `main` branch
     (via `git show main:plugins/sdlc-workflow/skills/plan-feature/SKILL.md`)
   - **pr-branch** — uses the current working `SKILL.md`
3. Each subagent receives the skill instructions, the test prompt, mock
   fixture files, and writes outputs to a workspace directory.
4. Grade each run against the assertions in `evals.json`.
5. Produce `grading.json`, `timing.json`, and `benchmark.json`.

### Baseline strategy

Baselines are git-based. The `main` branch serves as the reference — no
manual snapshots are needed. This works naturally with feature branches:
edit `SKILL.md` on a branch, and evals automatically compare the branch
version against the committed `main` version.

Committed baselines in `baselines/<commit-hash>/` preserve grading results
for historical comparison. The commit hash identifies which version of the
skill produced the baseline.

### When to run evals

- Before committing changes to any `SKILL.md` under `skills/plan-feature/`.
- After incorporating feedback from real-world usage into the skill.
- When refactoring shared resources (e.g., `task-description-template.md`)
  that plan-feature depends on.

## Reading benchmark.json

`benchmark.json` summarizes pass rates, timing, and token usage across all
test cases for both configurations:

```json
{
  "run_summary": {
    "pr-branch": {
      "pass_rate": { "mean": 1.0, "stddev": 0.0 },
      "time_seconds": { "mean": 191.62, "stddev": 47.5 },
      "tokens": { "mean": 41571, "stddev": 4316 }
    },
    "base-branch": {
      "pass_rate": { "mean": 1.0, "stddev": 0.0 },
      "time_seconds": { "mean": 187.23, "stddev": 49.66 },
      "tokens": { "mean": 40178, "stddev": 3191 }
    },
    "delta": {
      "pass_rate": 0.0,
      "time_seconds": 4.39,
      "tokens": 1393
    }
  }
}
```

| Field | What to look for |
|-------|-----------------|
| `pass_rate.mean` | 1.0 = all assertions passed. Below 1.0 = regressions. |
| `delta.pass_rate` | Positive = branch improved. Negative = branch regressed. Zero = parity. |
| `time_seconds` | Large increases may indicate the skill is doing unnecessary work. |
| `tokens` | Token usage proxy for cost. Compare across iterations. |

Each eval also produces individual results:

- `grading.json` — per-assertion pass/fail with evidence text
- `timing.json` — duration, token count, and tool use count for the run

## Adding new test cases

1. **Create fixture files** in `files/` for any new mock data the test case
   needs (feature description, repo manifest, etc.). Follow the annotation
   header convention from `CONVENTIONS.md`.

2. **Add an entry** to the `evals` array in `evals.json`:

   ```json
   {
     "id": 5,
     "prompt": "Plan the implementation for feature TC-9005...",
     "expected_output": "Description of what good output looks like.",
     "files": ["files/feature-new-scenario.md", "files/repo-backend.md"],
     "assertions": [
       "Assertion 1 — what the grader should check",
       "Assertion 2 — another check"
     ]
   }
   ```

3. **Run the eval** to verify the test case works and produces meaningful
   grading results.

### Writing good assertions

- **Prefer structural assertions** (section presence, task count, path
  validity) over semantic ones — they are more reliable.
- **Use semantic assertions** only for qualities that can't be checked
  mechanically (e.g., "flags ambiguous requirements").
- Assertions are graded by an LLM judge, so write them as clear,
  unambiguous natural language statements.

### When to add test cases

- When real-world usage reveals a failure mode not covered by existing tests.
- When adding new capabilities to the skill.

### When to remove assertions

- When an assertion always passes in both configurations across multiple
  iterations — it no longer measures skill value.

## Iteration workflow

The eval framework supports an iterative improvement cycle:

```
┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐
│  Run evals  │────▶│    Grade    │────▶│   Review    │────▶│   Improve   │
│             │     │             │     │  (human)    │     │  SKILL.md   │
└─────────────┘     └─────────────┘     └─────────────┘     └──────┬──────┘
       ▲                                                           │
       └───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 1. Run

Invoke skill-creator to run all test cases against both configurations
(base-branch and pr-branch).

### 2. Grade

skill-creator grades each run against the assertions in `evals.json` and
produces `grading.json` per eval and `benchmark.json` for the overall
summary.

### 3. Review

Review the actual outputs and record specific, actionable feedback in
`feedback.json`:

```json
{
  "eval-1": "",
  "eval-2": "Plan treated vague criteria as precise — generated specific file paths not in the mock repo.",
  "eval-3": ""
}
```

Empty string means the output passed review. Non-empty string is a specific
complaint to address in the next iteration.

### 4. Improve

Feed skill-creator the three signals:
- Failed assertions from `grading.json`
- Human feedback from `feedback.json`
- Execution transcripts from the workspace

skill-creator proposes `SKILL.md` changes. Review and apply them.

### 5. Repeat

Re-run evals. Compare `benchmark.json` against the previous iteration.
Stop when:
- `feedback.json` entries are consistently empty
- `pass_rate` delta plateaus (no further improvement)

### Committing baselines

After a successful iteration, commit the baseline results to
`baselines/<commit-hash>/` where `<commit-hash>` is the short hash of the
skill commit that produced the results. This preserves the grading history
for future comparison.
