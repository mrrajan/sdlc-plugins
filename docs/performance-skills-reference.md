## performance-setup

**Invocation:** `/sdlc-workflow:performance-setup [path]`

**One-time setup to initialize performance configuration.**

| Input | Output |
|---|---|
| Target repository path (optional) | `.claude/performance-config.md` |
| User responses (baseline settings, targets) | Target directories created |

**What it does:**
1. Discovers routes and modules from codebase
2. Collects configuration (browser settings, targets)
3. Creates `.claude/performance-config.md`
4. Creates directories: `baselines/`, `analysis/`, `plans/`, `verification/`

**Default targets:** LCP 2500ms, FCP 1800ms, TTI 3500ms, Total Load 4000ms

---

## performance-workflow-discovery

**Invocation:** `/sdlc-workflow:performance-workflow-discovery [path]`

**Discover workflows and prompt user to select one.**

| Input | Output |
|---|---|
| Target repository path (optional) | Updated config with "Selected Workflow" |
| User selection (workflow number) | Workflow scenarios identified |

**What it does:**
1. Reads router configuration
2. Discovers workflows (user journeys)
3. Presents table with workflow options
4. Saves user selection to config

---

## performance-baseline

**Invocation:** `/sdlc-workflow:performance-baseline [path]`

**Capture performance metrics using Playwright.**

| Input | Output |
|---|---|
| Target repository path (optional) | `baseline-report.md` |
| User confirmation: test data available? | Metrics: LCP, FCP, TTI, Total Load Time |

**Prerequisites:** Application running on localhost, Playwright installed

**What it does:**
1. Verifies test data availability
2. Runs Playwright automation (5 iterations by default)
3. Captures Core Web Vitals + resource timing
4. Generates report with p95 metrics

**Key metrics captured:**
- LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)
- FCP (First Contentful Paint)
- TTI (Time to Interactive)
- Total Load Time
- Resource breakdown (scripts, CSS, images, API calls)

---

## performance-analyze-module

**Invocation:** `/sdlc-workflow:performance-analyze-module [path]`

**Inspect source code to detect performance anti-patterns.**

| Input | Output |
|---|---|
| Target repository path (optional) | `workflow-analysis-report.md` |
| Baseline data | Anti-pattern findings with severity, impact, locations |

**Key distinction:** This skill **inspects source code**. The next skill (plan-optimization) **reads this report**.

**What it does:**
1. Reads baseline data
2. **Analyzes source code** (components, API calls, resources)
3. Detects 9 anti-patterns (see table below)
4. Classifies severity (High/Medium/Low)
5. Estimates impact (time or KB savings)
6. Locates code instances (file paths, line numbers)
7. Generates recommendations

**Anti-patterns detected:**

| Anti-Pattern | What It Detects |
|---|---|
| Over-fetching | API responses with unused fields |
| N+1 queries | Sequential API calls in loops |
| Waterfall loading | Sequential resource dependencies |
| Render-blocking resources | Synchronous scripts/styles in critical path |
| Unused code | Dead code, unreachable branches |
| Expensive re-renders | Missing React.memo, useMemo, useCallback |
| Long tasks | Main thread blocking > 50ms |
| Layout thrashing | Forced reflows in loops |
| Missing lazy loading | Large components loaded eagerly |

---

## performance-plan-optimization

**Invocation:** `/sdlc-workflow:performance-plan-optimization [path]`

**Read analysis report and create Jira Epic + Tasks.**

| Input | Output |
|---|---|
| Target repository path (optional) | Jira Epic + Tasks |
| Analysis report | `optimization-plan.md` |

**Key distinction:** This skill **reads the analysis report**. It does NOT inspect source code.

**What it does:**
1. **Reads** `workflow-analysis-report.md`
2. Groups optimizations by category (bundle size, API, render, resource, long task)
3. Calculates effort estimates
4. Creates Jira Epic: "Performance Optimization: {workflow}"
5. Creates Jira Tasks (one per category)
6. Links tasks with dependencies
7. Generates `optimization-plan.md`

**Task categories:**

| Category | Optimizations Included |
|---|---|
| Bundle Size Reduction | Code splitting, tree shaking, lazy loading, dead code removal |
| API Optimization | Reduce over-fetching, eliminate N+1 queries, parallel fetching |
| Render Optimization | Memoization, virtual scrolling, layout thrashing fixes |
| Resource Optimization | Async/defer scripts, parallel loading, compression |
| Long Task Mitigation | Code splitting, web workers, async patterns |

## performance-implement-optimization

**Invocation:** `/sdlc-workflow:performance-implement-optimization TC-XXXX`

**Execute optimization task with performance validation.**

| Input | Output |
|---|---|
| Jira task ID | Code changes committed to branch |
| Task description (from plan-optimization) | PR with before/after metrics |

**Extends:** `implement-task` workflow with performance steps

**What it does:**
1. Reads Jira task (standard + performance sections)
2. Inspects code and implements optimization
3. Runs functional tests
4. **Re-runs baseline** for affected scenarios
5. Compares results: current vs baseline vs targets
6. Stops if any metric regressed
7. Commits with `perf` type + performance impact in body
8. Creates PR with before/after table
9. Updates Jira and transitions to In Review

**Performance validation (Step 4):**
- Re-captures metrics after implementation
- Compares: baseline → current → target
- Stops execution if regression detected
- Continues if improvement (even if target not fully met)

---

## performance-verify-optimization

**Invocation:** `/sdlc-workflow:performance-verify-optimization TC-XXXX`

**Verify PR with optional baseline re-run.**

| Input | Output |
|---|---|
| Jira task ID | Verification report (PASS/WARN/FAIL) |
| PR reviews/comments | Sub-tasks for review feedback |

**Extends:** `verify-pr` workflow with performance validation

**What it does:**
1. Reads Jira task and PR
2. Checks out PR branch
3. Reads PR review feedback → creates sub-tasks for change requests
4. **Prompts:** "Re-run baseline? (yes/no)"
   - If yes: re-runs baseline, flags >10% drift
   - If no: uses implementation results from PR
5. Validates target achievement (Full/Partial Success, Regression)
6. Runs standard PR checks (scope, CI, acceptance criteria)
7. Generates verification report
8. Posts to PR and Jira

**Target achievement classification:**

| Result | Criteria |
|---|---|
| Full Success | All target metrics met |
| Partial Success | Improvement > 20% but targets not fully met |
| Insufficient Improvement | Improvement < 20% |
| Regression | Any metric worse than baseline |

**Overall result:**
- **PASS:** All checks pass or N/A
- **WARN:** At least one WARN, no FAIL
- **FAIL:** At least one FAIL
